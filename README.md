In this project a vehicle concept optimization tool is developed for the design of autonomous electric buses. The vehicle concept is optimized along the specified bus routes of a public transport network using a multi-criteria objective function. 
A multicriteria design optimization is conducted on the properties of . for autonomous electric buses. This model optimizes the vehicle concept based on value properties for the stakeholders. 
The vehicles are optimized for a given set of route(s).
